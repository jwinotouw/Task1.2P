            <h4>What is responsive web design and why it is important?</h4>
            <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design strategy that seeks to make 
                web pages render effectively across a number of devices and window or screen 
                sizes ranging from small to large to ensure usability and satisfaction. 
                This is how you design for a multi-device web. This implies that a 
                RWD-designed website will automatically adjust for multiple screen sizes 
                and viewports, utilising HTML and CSS to resize, conceal, reduce, or grow 
                a website to make it seem excellent on all platforms (desktops, tablets, 
                and phones).

                RWD is important since it allows for automatic screen adaptation whether 
                the website is viewed on a tablet, phone, television, or watch. This will 
                make sure that consumers will be able to access and have a positive experience 
                from browsing the website using any devices they own. As a result, RWD will 
                make an increased traffic to the website.

            <h4>How to implement responsive web design with HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <p>Responsive web design is a method of creating web pages that look well across 
                a range of devices or screen sizes. It is accomplished through the use of a 
                combination of adaptable layouts, pictures, and CSS media queries. Here's how 
                to use HTML and CSS to develop responsive site design:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of utilising fixed-width layouts, employ a flexible grid layout 
                        that can adjust to the size of the screen. This may be accomplished by use 
                        relative units such as percentages or ems rather than fixed units such as pixels.</li>
                    <li>Use flexible images: Images should also be adaptable to screen size. 
                        This may be accomplished by setting the image's max-width property to 100%, 
                        which causes it to scale down as necessary but never to scale up to be greater 
                        than its original size.</li>
                    <li>Use CSS media queries: Media queries allow you to apply various styles 
                        based on the properties of the device, such as its width, height, and 
                        orientation.</li>
                </ul>
